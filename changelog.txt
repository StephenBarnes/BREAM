Version: 1.4.1
Date: 17. 08. 2024
  Features:
    - Separate safety settings for large electric poles vs all other types (for Desolation modpack).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.0
Date: 10. 08. 2024
  Features:
    - Added compatibility for Toxic Biters mod, Frost Biters mod, and Explosive Biters mod.
    - Bugs now spawn in the same size ratios as in the vanilla game. Bugs from supported mods will also spawn in the same size ratios as in their respective mods.
    - If mods are active, toxic/frost/explosive bugs will only spawn once evolution is over 10%. Snappers (armoured biters) will only spawn once evolution is over 5%.
  Changes:
    - Default value for starting peace time is now 10 minutes instead of 5 minutes.
    - Changed default settings so instead of each spawn consuming 30-90% of the chunk's pollution, it consumes 20-60%. So bugs spawn more often, in smaller groups.

Version: 1.3.0
Date: 07. 07. 2024
  Features:
    - For lights, power poles, railroads, and rail signals: added options to make biters ignore them or target them.
    - Added option to print to console when spawning enemies.
  Balancing:
    - Adjusted default settings to be easier, because I did some playtesting and got absolutely crushed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 22. 06. 2024

  Balancing:

    - Modified curve of bug size by evolution so only small bugs will be spawned at low evolution.
