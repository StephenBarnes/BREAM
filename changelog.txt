Version: 2.1.0
Date: 10. 12. 2024
  Features:
    - Added compatibility with Behemoth Enemies mod.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash when building rails.
    - Rail safety settings now apply to rail supports, rail ramps, elevated rails, and 2.0's diagonal/curved rails.
    - Added foundation as a default safe tile.

Version: 2.0.0
Date: 9. 12. 2024
  Features:
    - Updated to Factorio 2.0.
    - Works with or without Space Age. Enemies are spawned on Nauvis and Gleba.
    - Added separate consumption multipliers for pollution vs spores, and separate min-pollution settings for pollution and spores. (Necessary because spore amounts tend to be lower than pollution.)
  Balancing:
    - Changed default settings to be somewhat harder, and create fewer, larger attacks. (But there's still frequent groups of 1-2 to probe your defenses.)
  Changes:
    - Setting with list of surfaces to spawn enemies onto has now been separated by enemy "phylum" (Nauvian bugs vs Gleban pentapods).
    - Removed compatibility with Larger Lamps and Industrial Revolution 3, which aren't ported to Factorio 2.0. (Still compatible with Armoured Biters, Explosive Biters, Frost Biters, Toxic Biters.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.0
Date: 10. 08. 2024
  Features:
    - Added compatibility for Toxic Biters mod, Frost Biters mod, and Explosive Biters mod.
    - Bugs now spawn in the same size ratios as in the vanilla game. Bugs from supported mods will also spawn in the same size ratios as in their respective mods.
    - If mods are active, toxic/frost/explosive bugs will only spawn once evolution is over 10%. Snappers (armoured biters) will only spawn once evolution is over 5%.
  Changes:
    - Default value for starting peace time is now 10 minutes instead of 5 minutes.
    - Changed default settings so instead of each spawn consuming 30-90% of the chunk's pollution, it consumes 20-60%. So bugs spawn more often, in smaller groups.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.0
Date: 07. 07. 2024
  Features:
    - For lights, power poles, railroads, and rail signals: added options to make biters ignore them or target them.
    - Added option to print to console when spawning enemies.
  Balancing:
    - Adjusted default settings to be easier, because I did some playtesting and got absolutely crushed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 22. 06. 2024
  Features:
    - Added "lit safe tiles" setting.
  Balancing:
    - Adjusted default settings: increased entity block radius 5->15, lamp safety factor 1->1.2.
    - Modified curve of bug size by evolution so only small bugs will be spawned at low evolution.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 01. 06. 2024
  Features:
    - Pollution used by BREAM to spawn bugs is now shown in the pollution statistics window.
