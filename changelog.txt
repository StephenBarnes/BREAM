Version: 1.4.0
Date: 10. 08. 2024
  Features:
    - Added compatibility for Toxic Biters mod, Frost Biters mod, and Explosive Biters mod.
    - Bugs now spawn in the same size ratios as in the vanilla game. Supported mods' bugs spawn in the same size ratios as in their respective mods.
    - Mods' bug types (armoured, toxic, frost, explosive) will only spawn once evolution is over 10%.
  Changes:
    - TODO increase default grace time
    - TODO change default setting for what fraction of chunk's pollution to consume per spawn, so that bugs are spawned more frequently but in smaller groups
