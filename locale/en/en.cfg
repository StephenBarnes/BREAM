[mod-setting-description]
BREAM-surfaces-to-spawn-nauvis-enemies=Comma-separated list of surfaces to spawn Nauvis-type enemies (biters, spitters, and modded variants of those).
BREAM-surfaces-to-spawn-gleba-enemies=Comma-separated list of surfaces to spawn Gleba-type enemies (wrigglers, strafers, stompers, and modded variants of those).
BREAM-safe-tiles=Comma-separated list of tiles that should count as "safe", if you turn on the setting that makes "safe" tiles block bug spawns.
BREAM-spawn-every-seconds=This is how often the mod will try to spawn enemies. Most times it tries to spawn enemies, it will fail, because there's other objects in the way, or there's not enough pollution, etc.
BREAM-spawn-at-all-chance=Set to 1.0 to spawn soon after pollution reaches the minimum threshold. Set to a lower value like 0.2 to create larger, less frequent attacks. The startup setting "spawn every N ticks" controls how often we try to spawn enemies, and then each time that timer goes off, we randomly decide whether we should spawn at all by looking at the probability in this setting.
BREAM-num-chunks-to-check=The startup setting "spawn every N ticks" controls how often we try to spawn enemies, then each time that timer goes off, this setting here determines how many random chunks we try to spawn enemies onto. A high number might cause lag. Set this to zero to try spawning onto all generated chunks, instead of only a few random chunks - this might cause lag depending on how big your map is.
BREAM-starting-peace-minutes=When a new game is started, how many minutes of peace there should be before BREAM starts spawning bugs.
BREAM-only-spawn-when-dark=If enabled, BREAM will only spawn bugs when the surface's darkness is above a threshold, which generally means they'll spawn at night. This does not affect vanilla bug mechanics - nests will still send bugs to attack you even during the day. Compatible with the Clockwork mod. Works the same as the nocturnal setting in the Rampant mod.
BREAM-player-spawn-block-radius=Bugs will not be spawned within this radius of any players. Set to 0 to disable.
BREAM-water-tile-spawn-block-radius=Bugs will not spawn within this distance of any water tiles. Set to 0 to disable, which could spawn enemies on water. Also applies to lava tiles.
BREAM-safe-tile-spawn-block-radius=Bugs will not be spawned within this distance of any "safe" tiles such as stone bricks and concrete. See the startup settings to customize what tiles count as "safe". Set to 0 to disable.
BREAM-lit-safe-tile-spawn-block-radius=Same as the safe tile setting, but safe tiles only count if they have a light nearby or it's daytime. Set to 0 to disable.
BREAM-entity-spawn-block-radius=Bugs will not spawn within this distance of any entities, such as buildings and transport belts. Set to 0 to disable. This check ignores entities classified as ore patches, trees, or rocks.
BREAM-lamp-safety-factor=Lamps will prevent bugs from spawning within their light, if the lamp is turned on. Set this to 0 to disable lamp safety completely. The lights from vanilla have a light radius of 17, while lamps from mods can have different radiuses. This setting multiplies the safe radius, so if you set this to 1, the safe radius of every lamp will be where the light from the lamp ends. If you set this to 0.5, the safe radius of every lamp will be halved, so enemies could spawn inside the light. Higher values like 1.5 make it easier to ensure nothing spawns inside your factory.
BREAM-enemy-spawn-block-radius=Bugs will not spawn if they're within this distance of some number of other bugs, determined by the setting right below this one. Set to 0 to disable, although that might cause large amounts of enemies to build up on islands, so it is not recommended.
BREAM-enemy-count-for-spawn-blocking=Bugs will not spawn when there's this many bugs or more within the radius set by the previous setting.
BREAM-extra-bug-class-chance=Every time bugs are spawned, we pick one class (like biter, spitter, snapper), and then add each additional class with this probability. The swarm is then built out of the selected classes. If you have many bug classes due to a mod, and you have made them compatible with BREAM, you should choose a lower number here.
BREAM-max-bugs-per-swarm=When building a swarm, the mod tries to add more bugs until the pollution budget has been consumed, but it will stop early if it reaches this number. High numbers might cause lag.
BREAM-pollution-cost-multiplier=Setting this to 1.0 makes bugs cost the same amount of pollution as when bugs are spawned from a nest. Setting to 2 will make them cost 2x as much, so half as many will be spawned. Set it to 0.1 to make BREAM swarms cost 1/10 what the same bugs would cost from a nest. Consider setting this lower than 1, since BREAM doesn't absorb pollution over time like a nest does.
BREAM-min-pollution-for-spawn=Bugs will only spawn in chunks with at least this much pollution.
BREAM-spawn-chance-at-min-pollution=The chance that bugs will be spawned in a chunk that is at the minimum pollution. As pollution rises, the spawn chance increases linearly until reaching the maximum, set in the two settings below this one.
BREAM-pollution-for-max-spawn-chance=If a chunk has this much pollution or more, the spawn chance will reach its maximum, set in the setting below this one.
BREAM-spawn-chance-at-max-pollution=The chance that bugs will be spawned in a chunk with pollution greater than the amount specified in the setting above this one.
BREAM-pollution-fraction-per-swarm-min=When spawning a swarm, what fraction of that chunk's pollution should be used to purchase units for the swarm. This fraction is randomly chosen between this setting and the setting right below this one. So if pollution is 100, and this value is 0.2, and the next setting is 0.4, then we will spend between 20 and 40 pollution to make this one swarm.
BREAM-pollution-fraction-per-swarm-max=See the setting above this one.
BREAM-enemy-spawner-health-multiplier=The health of all enemy bases will be multiplied by this number. Set to 1 to disable. A value of 5 is still easy to kill with a flamethrower. This setting is provided to help you balance your game, because a side effect of using BREAM is that some tools are less useful than in vanilla. For example, poison capsules are mostly useful against bases, not swarms of free-roaming bugs. So you could use this setting to make bases stronger, to make those tools more useful again.
BREAM-enemy-spawner-healing-multiplier=The health of all enemy bases will be multiplied by this number. Set to 1 to disable. See the setting above for an explanation.
BREAM-make-lamps-military-targets=If enabled, the mod will mark lamps as high-priority military targets, causing bugs to attack them more, even when they're switched off. This setting is included because this mod optionally makes lamps prevent bugs from spawning nearby while they're switched on, so having the bugs attack lamps creates an extra challenge.
BREAM-make-electric-poles-military-targets=Marks electric poles as military targets, so bugs will attack them more. This setting gives you a way to incentivize generating power locally at outposts rather than connecting all outposts to one big electrical network.

BREAM-safety-lamps=Note that there are some issues with changing these bug reaction settings in an existing game. When you build something while this is "never attack", it will be marked as safe forever, even if you later change the setting. If you build something and then later set this to "never attack", existing buildings will not be marked as safe. However, switching between "default" and "attack on sight" will not cause any problems.

BREAM-debug-printing=Report actions into the in-game chat, for debugging your settings or the mod. If the text moves too fast, pause the game to read it. Note every line of debug output has a random number at the start to prevent Factorio from hiding duplicate lines. You can use the "player position spawn suitability" debug option to see whether enemy spawning would be permitted at the player's current position, and if not, the reason why not.
